A simple module for reading Python configuration files

Python configuration files themselves are actual Python files. The module reads
only values in uppercase from them, checks that they contain only basic Python
types and returns a dictionary which corresponds to the configuration file.

Note: if you want to validate the configuration values, take a look at
https://github.com/KonishchevDmitry/object-validator project.
